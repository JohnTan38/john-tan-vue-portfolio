    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I was a career banker who transitioned to AI / ML in 2015. I was hooked from the start and now
      work as a full time data analyst and hobby full stack developer. While I love design and enjoy creative, responsive frontends,
      I've discovered that my true passion is the backend: querying databases, using APIs, automating business processes.
      My projects encompass a bit of both worlds, but there will be mostly data-related projects in the future.
